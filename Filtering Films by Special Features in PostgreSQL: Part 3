/*


Write a PostgreSQL query that selects film_id, the title and special_features columns from the film table in the DVD rental database, and returns films that have either "Deleted Scenes" or "Behind the Scenes" as a special feature, but not both - meaning that if there are "Deleted Scenes", there should not be "Behind the Scenes" and vice versa. The query should also exclude films that have "Commentaries" as a special feature.

Notes:

for the sample tests, static dump of DVD Rental Sample Database is used, for the final solution - random tests.
The result should be order by title alphabetically, if title is the same - then by film_id in asc order.
special_features is the text[] type. It represents a one-dimensional array of values, where each value is of the text data type.
