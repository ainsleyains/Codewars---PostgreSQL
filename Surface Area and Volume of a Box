/*

You are given a table box with the following columns: width (int), height (int), depth (int). Those values will be greater than 0.

Write an SQL query that returns these columns:

width
height
depth
area (int) - the total surface area of the box.
volume (int) - the volume of the box. Sort the results by area ascending, then by volume ascending, then by width ascending, and finally by height in ascending order.

SELECT width,
       height,
       depth,
       (2 * (depth * width + depth * height + width * height)) AS area,
       width * height * depth AS volume
FROM box
ORDER BY area, volume, width, height;
