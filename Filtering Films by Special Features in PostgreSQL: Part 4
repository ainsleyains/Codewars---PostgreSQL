Write a PostgreSQL query that selects film_id, the title and special_features columns from the film table in the DVD rental database, and returns all films that have the most popular feature as one of their features. By "most popular" is meant that it appears most frequently among all the special features amidst all films of film table

Notes:

for the sample tests, static dump of DVD Rental Sample Database is used, for the final solution - random tests.
The result should be ordered by title alphabetically, if title is the same - then by film_id in asc order.
let's assume that there are no ties for the most frequent special feature
in special_features there are no duplicates - all values are unique
Schema:

film table:

Column            | Type      | Modifiers
------------------+-----------+-----------
film_id           | integer   | not null
title             | varchar   | not null
description       | text      | not null
release_year      | integer   | not null
language_id       | integer   | not null 
rental_duration   | integer   | not null
rental_rate       | numeric   | not null
length            | integer   | not null
replacement_cost  | numeric   | not null
rating            | varchar   | not null
last_update       | timestamp | not null
special_features  | text[]    | not null
Desired Output

The desired output should look like this:

film_id | title                             | special_features                       |
--------+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
   32   | A Shawshank Redemption            | {Trailers, Deleted Scenes}             | 
   14   | Monty Python and the Holy Grail   | {Trailers, Deleted Scenes}             |
